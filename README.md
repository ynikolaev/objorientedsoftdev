I designed and developed a JavaSE desktop City Guide Application for reviewing restaurants. The user is able to add new items (restaurants, reviews etc.) to the guide with a title, location, picture and type. The items are organised into categories, users are able to search for, and view items already stored within the system, in addition to being able to add ratings. Items and ratings are stored in SQLite database.
